I'm 19 years-old fullstack developer and working 80 hours per week and currently working on [Bloomy](https://github.com/sametalpdeger/Bloomy). I can create mobile apps, websites, desktop apps and backend services. I'm interested in kotlin and web development. I like to learn new things and I love computers. I have many other hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games.
