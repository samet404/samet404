# Hello ðŸŒ±

I'm 19 years-old fullstack developer, working 100 hours per week and currently working on [Dysphoria](https://github.com/HellowStudios/Dysphoria), [Aspect](https://github.com/aspect-chat/aspect-chat) and [Bloomy](https://github.com/sametalpdeger/Bloomy).

I can create mobile apps, websites, desktop apps and backend services. I like to learn new things and love computers. I have so many hobbies like reading, writing, watching movies, and playing games :P
